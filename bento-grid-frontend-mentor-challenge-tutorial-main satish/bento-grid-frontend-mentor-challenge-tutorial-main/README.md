## The tutorial

This repo is for [a video tutorial by Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/h4dHvo09cG4) taking on [Frontend Mentor's challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj?via=kevinpowell) of creating the Bento grid pictured above.

## Following along

### The Files

The files in the root folder (`index.html` and `style.css`) are the starting point from my tutorial.

The finished version of the HTML is unchanged, and the final CSS is in the `style-FINISHED.css` file.

You can refer to that file if you get stuck, or update the link in the HTML file to see the finished version.

The starting code does have some styling applied already, though nothing related to the bento grid itself.

If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can refer to [the original challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bento-grid-RMydElrlOj?via=kevinpowell).

### Development Server

I used Vite, so if you want to run the dev server while working, in your terminal:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

If you've never used npm before, you can use the a live server extension instead, or you can learn more about [getting started with npm from this video](https://youtu.be/UYz-9UaUp2E).
